## What research question(s) are you trying to answer?
1. In what ways do archival technologies (Flickr, IG, Tumblr, Are.na, YouTube,  custom platforms etc) mediate the relationship between users and their data in ways that alter how they think about the contours and affects of memory, ownership, privacy, and capture.

2. How do current data paradigms disturb and restrict our methods of knowledge-making, kin-making, and place-making?

3. How might archival forms of data fugitivity and disobedience serve as methods of designing otherwise?

## Who are you interviewing? Name, age, background information
Oral historian

## What makes them a good interview subject for this question?
This person wrote an essay on information sovereignty that I thought was very profound and related to this research. They specifically spoke about this and the internet but their professional work lives in library systems. Because they were trained as an information scientist and work in a library (that houses their own local archives as well) I thought her professional and personal perspective was interesting to answer all three of my questions.

## What is your interview script (at least 8-12 questions)?
intro

Before we begin, can I record a transcript of this session just for my notes for class? No quotes, comments, recordings, or identifying information about you will be used and I'll be deleting the recording after I take notes about my reflections from our conversation and using the transcript for documentation.

### questions
1. Pluralistic commons particularly when it comes to data. a lot of current data paradigms flatten and render our lives very clearly defined even through reality is never that clear, especially for those at the margins.
2. Can you tell me a bit about the technologies you use to archive information or even just the technologies that interact with or archive your information unconsensually?
3. what would have to be different about the technologies you've mentioned in order for them to honor your information and respect a plurality of information?
4. You wrote a piece on digital divestment as a way to reclaim information sovereignty, can you speak some about why you wrote this and your thoughts?
5. You also spoke in the piece a bit aobut epistemic disobedience. How do you think that works in service of reclaiming our relationship with our information and knowledge?
6. what you would say of how collective memory is developed and mediated in a highly technological world
7. Can you tell me a bit about the technology that you use in your librarian work? What are their affordances and limitations?
8. we are in a very hypervisible moment, intentionality, accountability, and respect is necessary for choosing otherwise. how do we balance the need or desire to be visible for access and support, versus protecting our knowledge?
