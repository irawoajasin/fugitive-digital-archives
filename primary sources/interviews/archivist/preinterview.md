## What research question(s) are you trying to answer?
1. In what ways do archival technologies (Flickr, IG, Tumblr, Are.na, YouTube,  custom platforms etc) mediate the relationship between users and their data in ways that alter how they think about the contours and affects of memory, ownership, privacy, and capture.

2. How do current data paradigms disturb and restrict our methods of knowledge-making, kin-making, and place-making?

3. How might archival forms of data fugitivity and disobedience serve as methods of designing otherwise?

## Who are you interviewing? Name, age, background information
This is a current Masters student at NYU who is doing their thesis and research on Decolonial Black Imaginaries through archival studies. They have been a practicing archivist for the past 5 years and have worked more closely with the Black Archives in Netherlands, documenting and stewarding the experiences of Black people and histories within the Netherlands. They are Surinamese, Dutch, Queer, and in their mid-twenties.

## What makes them a good interview subject for this question?
Interviewing them was important to me in that they are trained as an archivist, have made specific and local decisions about how archives are designed, have worked in several archival contexts, and specifially work within marginal archives that are community owned, generated, and stewarded. Working with Black archives in a colonial context requires a deep understanding about the sociopolitical needs of holding information with deep regard. Through this interview, I hope to primarily explore question 3, looking at their approaches to archiving from the margins and the relationship that Black people have to archival tools. I also intend of probing about what technologies they use in their professional and personal archival work, asking about the confines and impacts of those platforms on archival methods.


## What is your interview script (at least 8-12 questions)?
intro

Before we begin, can I record a transcript of this session just for my notes for class? No quotes, comments, recordings, or identifying information about you will be used and I'll be deleting the recording after I take notes about my reflections from our conversation and using the transcript for documentation.

1. What kind of work you do/have done with the Black Archives?
2. Can you tell me a bit about your personal history with archiving?

5. Can you tell me a bit about the technologies you use to archive information or even just the technologies that interact with or archive your information unconsensually?

7. How is collective memory and imagination developed and mediated in a highly technological world
8. We are in a very hypervisible moment, intentionality, accountability, and respect is necessary for choosing otherwise. how do we balance the need or desire to be visible for access and support, versus protecting our knowledge?
