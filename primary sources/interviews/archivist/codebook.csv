GRASSROOTS,,"In contrast to traditional archives, grassroots",“I think it's more like a community space. That is what usually happens when it starts out as a grassroots organization. “,"The compelling thing about grassroots archives here is the specificity and control that community members have over how they are remembered and how they go through the process of rememory. This includes not just having the archives available but having events, talks, activities, etc that engage community members through connecting with the archives at a deeper level."
EPHEMERAL,"Loss, Digital Decay",ephemera from daily life being collected and analyzed. Also applied to the ephemerality of archives themselves,"“I started becoming aware of archiving when I would travel, because you're more aware of like, Oh, it's so temporary.” ““What happens if the archive, the black archives, dies? Then I would trust that the black archives lives forth in people's bodies and homes, and that someone else will start it again.”","We archive things because we want to preserve them in our collective memory. If we don’t, we risk their physical essence and imprint on our psyche fading away. What was interesting here was that while there is this desire to have a grip on our memories, it is a radical act to let their physical forms go through cycles of decomposition and ensure that they stay alive through other means. I also find there to be an interest link here with the idea of digital decay where website and physical storage information is removed, outdated, or otherwise dies and we lose access to our online data and memories. We want to archive online because it feels more permanent, spacious, and reliable, however because we lack real control over these platforms, we may have even less control over how our memories are stored and how we interact with them."
CAPTURE,,Discussion about how materials are captured and how specific decision making goes into what is captured and what is not. Also discussion on who is doing the capturing and what can never be captured,"“writing can say so much already about what someone even finds important to like, put on a page and like, capture and save”","There are very clear and personal decisions around what someone chooses to capture or note. This reflects their viewpoint, values, and perspective about the world around them. While this is true for people collecting documents and memories, it is also true for archival institutions and technology institutions, making specific decisions about what is “worth” capturing and holding ownership of, and what is not."
RELATIONALITY,INTIMATE,"Building an intimate relationship with the archive, its contents, and its related community through repeated interactions, engaging in the materials, and practicing reflection.","“[writing] also feels sometimes even more personal than like talking, because, like, sometimes it's easier to write something down than like talk about it” “it needs to, like, revolve around care and relationality and being very accessible”","Relationality came through as a core tenant of radical archiving. Specifically this looking like building an intimate relationship with the archival materials you are engaging with, seeing yourself in them, and connecting them to your lineage and history. It also contained elements of engaging with others through the archives, understanding them from various points of view. I really liked how intimate of a practice this felt like. We get to know ourselves, our communities, and these documents in deeper and more intimate ways when we practice this relationship with them. There also was a lot in how much of ourselves lives in the things we collect and choose to archive. The documents we archive and the method in which we archive exist on a spectrum of levels of intimacy, highlighting vulnerability in accessing, capturing, and observing existing archives. I’d be interested to think a bit more about ideas of relationality and intimacy in how we share and study data about each other"
TECHNOLOGY,"Online archives, apps, spreadsheet, video, tags, catalog",Mentions of the technologies used within archiving,"“with every book that I catalog, I need to make like tags for if people like have certain search words that the book will show up. And that is already so difficult.”","This upholds a lot of the other reading and thinking I have been doing about technological mediation. There needs to be this clarity and preciseness within how these platforms organization information. Even if its not binary data but documents, photos, and text, there still is a preciseness and a flatness required in the capturing process. I find it interesting how much that is embedded in how the metadata and tag systems are designed. I also find it compelling to think about how the norms of how data is organized and tagged are set by hegemonic institutions. Here the archivist talks about how in order to remain legible to the general public, they need to follow conventions of tagging that were set by white dominant libraries. Disturbing that makes it hard to scale and remain accessible in some ways, but I wonder what it would look like to completely reject those models?"
ACCESSIBILITY,,Removing barriers and limitations to accessing the archive using various methods (digital and physical),"“So I think accessibility and also in the way that it is, like, easy for people to find. So I think the length of things, like archives can feel so ominous and so like vague”","I find it fascinating how often people reach for technology as an equalizer and a tool for bridging gaps. I think it is totally true that online space collapses the confines of physical space and allows the world to become that much smaller. I think that also requires further abstraction away from source material and localities. However, I suppose this abstraction (in a far more violent way) is what took these documents out of their contexts to begin with."
INTERGENERATIONALITY,"CHILDREN, elders","The role that children, elders, and just different generations engage with and are represented by the archive together","“another thing is intergenerationality, because, older people are literally archives.”","What does it mean to pass on information, knowledge, documents, and data? We hold this information in our bodies and we use containers and vessels external to ourselves to transport it to other means."
KNOWLEDGE SHARING,"Oral history, pictures, text, storytelling, performance, art-making",Description of methods of sharing and disseminating knowledge both in traditional and nontraditional contexts,"“it cannot always be captured in just pictures and text. It's like told through stories and storytelling and or through performance or dance or music. There's so many different mediums to even spread information, or knowledge or histories.”","In this, I’m thinking about alternative modes of sharing information from a fugitive perspective. Alternative mapmaking through cornrowing paths in your hair. Coming up with characters and folklore to describe approaches and methods of navigating live. What would it mean for a dataset or database to be built on folklore?"
DIALOGUE,,Where there is exchange of knowledge and experience through dialogue either with other people or with materials.,"“I think also the way that people engage with it should also be an aspect that, like the conversations around it and the dialog around it, should also be important to make an archive more alive”","Dialogue feels hard because it often requires some type of guiding and shepparding, especially when someone is new to the archival materials or information. There’s a desire to have your eye be directed at least at first before you get the hang of things. I suppose that’s where the importance of intimacy with the data comes in. You gain that intimacy and relationality through dialogue."
LOCALITY,place,"The physical dimension of the archives, particularly in relation to its relation to local cultures and histories.","“it shouldn't be just accessible in the Netherlands, because it's literally an archive from Suriname. So like people in Suriname need to have access to it. So then, like you immediately start to think about like a digital archive, and digitize, digitizing the materials.”","So this example talked about archival materials from Suriname being held and discussed about in the Netherlands, removed from their original contexts. This is making me think about diaspora, I suppose in these materials existing in the Netherlands, unique and situated relations with the archives emerge, divergent from what would be discussed in Suriname. Maybe things don’t always need to be situated around their origins? I also think about how digital archives still exist in physical space, like yes the actual documents may exist here in the Netherlands, and the documents are from Suriname originally, but their digitized forms now live in some data server somewhere, unknown to the archivist or the subject of the archives."
FLATTENED,"Time pressure, funding, desire to know the whole picture",Things that have the effect of flattening elements of the archive. Often external limitations and colonial/capitalistic beliefs,"“desire of wanting to know everything is understandable, but it's not something that can ever be fulfilled -- if someone would get all my journals right now, you don't know everything about that day. it's always, a curated part of that reality”","Context matters! There being limitations to how we interpret the archives exists beyond physical and digital means. We make choices about what to capture and how based on the limits of reality (time, funding, etc) but we can never truly know the full story. Maybe that is not the point?"
VALUES,"reliable, protected, love, joy, safe, trust",The values that an archive should harbor,"“[Online Black Archives should have a] feeling of safety and feeling that it is like reliable and protected and really made for the purpose of archiving or just for the purpose of just people and love and joy, and not for the purpose of commercial stuff.” “as communities of color, can we even trust these white institutions to care for our documents and knowledge and that they like keep that safe.”","Values of an ideal Radical Black Archive is just one built on trust, reliability, and love. Holding information with care and regard for their contexts and purposes."
critical fabulation,,Using methods of radical imagination to fill in the gaps of archives and history,"“You can also just work with what you have and use, like, critical fabulation”","This is such an important way to think about the limits of the archives. I listened to another lecture about the archive as being full of dead things, or where things go to die. This element of critical fabulation feels key to keeping things alive! We don’t engage in enough critical fabulation around data that is gathered about us or predictive models (which are doing their own type of fabulation through normalization)"
REFLECTIVE,,"Practices and methods of engaging in deep reflection through, with, and about the archives","“That's another part of archival work, being aware of how it changes you throughout the process. Going three times to the same archive, by the third time, you're already looking with different eyes/knowledge than the first time, and being very aware and reflective of your own thought processes about things too.”",I see this as another form of dialogue but just with yourself. Thinking about how you relate to and are impacted by the archives.
POSITIONALITY,"SITUATED KNOWLEDGE, SUBJECTIVE, who decides","Subjective experiences and perspectives within labeling, interpreting, and coming to conclusions about archival materials. How that subjectivity is impacted by other aspects of identity","“who decides what is like, valuable or not?” “It definitely gets flattened either way, it's just such a subjective process.”","We select what we think is important and frame our understanding of the world and its information as such. When approaching the archives or data, it is important to orient yourself around your own positionality. This feels necessary for a pluralistic archive, a pluralistic dataset."
EMBODIED,"embodied knowledge, spiritual knowledge, ancestral knowledge",Embracing other forms of knowing beyond documents like pictures and text,"“We're all archives like, in our like embodied experiences and wisdoms and just knowledge that we have”","Other ways that we can hold knowledge, hold data, and hold wisdom! Photos and text are such a small part of the way that we can hold information! What would other containers look like?"
ANTI FUTURES,HISTORY,"Anti-colonial and radical approaches to sustainability, preservation, and visions of the future. Embracing decay and regeneration","“We cannot do it with the same purpose that we want to have this information forever, or have the goal of existing forever, we need to imagine that maybe there won't be a future for this archive, and that to exist forever is not even the purpose.”","I was very fascinated by this concept, allowing things to go through cycles of decay and regeneration! I think often with data and digital information, we want things to exist forever, We assume that we have infinite space and energy and that because it’s “not physical” there is nothing to die. Finality on the internet feels like an unexplored thing. How to build this into a database? Not just decay, but creating methods to regenerate as well!"
OWNERSHIP,NO GRIP,Communities and people being in control of how their documents are held and treated. The ability to have sovereignty over their items,“Digital spaces just feel like you don't really have any grip on it”,"I love the use of the phrase “no grip” in relation to ownership. The feeling that things are slipping out of our fingers or possession. Having control over how your documents are held and being able to refuse or migrate are fundamental digital security concerns. I know that in this project and research, data sovereignty and security is key."
