## my primary research questions
1. In what ways do archival technologies (Flickr, IG, Tumblr, Are.na, YouTube,  custom platforms etc) mediate the relationship between users and their data in ways that alter how they think about the contours and affects of memory, ownership, privacy, and capture.

2. How do current data paradigms disturb and restrict our methods of knowledge-making, kin-making, and place-making?

3. How might archival forms of data fugitivity and disobedience serve as methods of designing otherwise?

## intentions with this interview
In her work, this technologist focuses on distributed infrastruction. I think with wifi in particular, this is seen as a material entrypoint to the immateriality of the internet and have that infrastructure demystified and worked on by the people for the people. In this interview, I want to better understand sociopolitical implications of the materiality of information.

## post interview thoughts
Relating this to the interview with the archivist, there is already themes of loss or like not having a "grip" on your resources because of centralized control. The emphasis on demystifying the black box also seems related to knowledge systems being free, open access, and legible to their constituants. We don't have this intimacy or deeper feeling of knowing around our technology and its infrastructure so we then feel alienated from it. When it then breaks or there are issues, we feel helpless.

"kind of harmful to your psyche to look at the world around you and to not have a good understanding of how it works"

These mesh nodes feel interesting in their relation to place, they work like cell sites in that you connect when you go near them and its all the same network, but since its decentralized and community run, there's an interesting like easter egg hunt when you find one in public. I know that when I've been out and seen NYCMesh as one of my wifi options in my phone, I internally relate it to an image of the actual, physical, mesh node that I know is somewhere nearby. This adds such an implicit materiality to these interactions. There's also this centrality of the "neighbor" as a node. We relate with the people and the physical infrastructure involved in the wifi service. Thus, we can engage in conversation and dialogue about how it is built, run, and how we engage with it.

"my life is bound up in the lives of my neighbors I can't simply I get to be holed up in my apartment and not think about the lives of the people around me"

Instead of the infrastructure being there to serve you and abstract any messy wires or interactions behind the scenes, this tech infrastructure necessitate connection and relationality.

"But I think the world is very oriented towards getting ourselves to view us as like individual customers with no connection or solidarity, but the people around us."

This feels similar to the idea that the archives are some mystical, secret, dark cave that are not accessible to wander through and be apart of. Touching the materials, understanding how they are labeled, defined, and even letting that system of organization be living along with the people stewarding it, allows for our systems to not remain rigid and allow for use to see ourselves and each other in our infra.

Context is really important for local infra, people have more information and understanding about their situated contexts, thus, they can more readily make specific decisions about how their infra is designed. That being said, there is still room and space for more general systems as sustainability is important.

"Twitter character of the week, where it's just like, you're taking a tiny fragment of someone's life and I've been exposing that to massive numbers of people. And like, of course, things are going to go badly when that happens. You could do that for everybody. "

This quote is interesting in its relationship with taking clips or summaries of peoples complex experiences. I think audience is an interesting thing here though, what do you lose when you make something accessible to *everyone*, especially when that something is only but a fragment of reality. 

"I think it feels like I'm in a constant war with every single piece of technology I own that always wants to gather my personal information in order to do those things."

When information is extracted from us, it makes us wary to trust, it makes us self-concious. We need spaces where we can give up information that is messy, weird, and different. Where we can be authentic and like we're not being watched, especially against our will. This impeded intimacy!

In order to have a more intimate relationship with this technology, we need to feel a greater sense of control over it. Transparency, confindence, trust. Specificity over the audiences that will be engageing with it and how they engage.
