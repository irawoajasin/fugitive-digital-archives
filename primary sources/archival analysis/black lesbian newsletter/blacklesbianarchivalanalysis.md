## Primary Source / Archival Analysis 

Last weekend, I went to the Queer Zine fair where I met an archivist from the Bay Area who was selling an archival collection titled “FROM MY ARCHIVE VOL.3: LESBIANS” that consisted of physical archival pieces and a flashdrive of his full collection of scanned items. It was in this collection that I selected my primary source document called “Black Lesbian Newsletter Vol. 1”. In my research, I have been fascinated by subaltern tactics of knowledge sharing, encryption, and protection of information through various means so I thought it would be pertinent to explore how these topics of privacy, secrecy, and control of information were discussed.

This newsletter was printed in December 1982, and seemingly distributed across 7 different physical outlets across the Bay Area (specifically San Francisco and the East Bay). On the first page displays a list of the staff that put work into putting this newsletter together. In total, 20 people, all identifying as Black lesbians, contributed to the editing, typewriting, fundraising, distribution, and more of the newsletter. The contents had the intent of sharing information pertaining to Black Lesbian community across the Bay area including community advertisements, announcements, and right up top as the first entry, calls for collective action and justice.|

The first entry taking up three whole pages was a description of a racist encounter at a bar where a bouncer ended up calling the police on a group of 6 Black lesbians. After the description was a clear analysis of what occurred (literally labeled “analysis”), a list of demands including a public apology and the bouncer being fired, and an outline of how the community should respond if their demands are not met by boycotting and getting the press involved. Through reading this artifact it is clear that this was not just a newsletter or collection of pieces for and by Black lesbians, it served as a way to share knowledge, create organizational strategies, and plan celebrations all in a collective format. While those initial 20 people contributing to the creation of this newsletter certainly had a hand in piecing this together. The audience was explicitly invited to share their own ads, calls for support, important community announcements, and more.

Close to the end of the artifact there was a quote that conveys the strong position of this piece, 

```
“Share these sources of strength and faith with you sisters through the Black Lesbian Newsletter. We need this in our support system and as an expressive outlet. The society has not and will not promote your voice being heard. We must speak for ourselves. We must validate ourselves.”
 - Anonymous
```

This is a stark call for community control of how knowledge, information, and outlets of expression are shared. I especially was interested in this as an anonymous entry, illustrating the importance of maintaining privacy and anonymity as a form of community protection. Being able to communicate and share information on your own terms in service of your own community.

To speak a bit more about its physical format, the materialisy allowed for it to be selectivley situated in locations of interest, namely lesbian bars and other places that were trusted to hold this entrypoint to this community with care. This ability to make decisions about how people enter into your collection serves as its own type of community key, if you are a regular or welcomed into a physical space, you are verified to get access to this published space and network. In a sense this is a type of authentification build into its physical distribution model. 

## insights
- Community control over how knowledge, info, and expression is shared
- Community control over secrecy of the archival container, the contents, and its constituents, building multiple layers of authentification or social encryption is vital
- These living collections of knowledge (not just this piece but many of the contents of the archive) are participatory works
