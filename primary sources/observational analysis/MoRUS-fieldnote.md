## my primary research questions
1. In what ways do archival technologies (Flickr, IG, Tumblr, Are.na, YouTube,  custom platforms etc) mediate the relationship between users and their data in ways that alter how they think about the contours and affects of memory, ownership, privacy, and capture.

2. How do current data paradigms disturb and restrict our methods of knowledge-making, kin-making, and place-making?

3. How might archival forms of data fugitivity and disobedience serve as methods of designing otherwise?

## jottings
- living data taking up every corner and crevice of the space
- signage from old buldings, beams, and mods of the actual building itself! there are videos, documents, news clippings, sculptures, zines, but also the building itself is part of the archive!
- Context and curation throughout but allowing documents to be seen, touched, and engaged with.
- Overheard the volunteers/workers say "funding is political, who gets to be funded is political" in reference to the space
- culture of hacking, modding, patching, and repair as agency and autonomy!

## field notes
> As a living history of urban activism, MoRUS chronicles the LES community’s history of grassroots action. It celebrates the local activists who transformed abandoned spaces and vacant lots into vibrant community spaces and gardens.

The Museum of Reclaimed urban space mostly functions as a museum, but in their grassroots collection of archival and cultural artifacts, I found it important to visit to get a sense of how they organize, label, and interact with this historical ephemera. When I arrived I realized that I in fact had been to this area before and didn't realize the the museum was here! After speaking to a couple people in the main lobby area, I realized that I have spent some time in the community gardens around the corner and across the street and they had a very close relationship with them. I spent some time walking around the main area, reading the labels and flipping through zines and things. It was clear that unlike archives that I had travered, this (obviously) was more of a curated museum feel with plaque giving context and links to more information being strewn around. That said, there was a distinctly different feeling with how the environment invited you in, I felt compelled to touch and engage with materials, I took pictures, there was a casual feel to the space that I dont find in traditional museums. As I explored the basement floor, one of the volunteers came in an said that there was going to be an improptu tour and that if I was interested I should join! I did so and essentially stumbled into a tour of the 3 block radius around the museum hosted by a guy who used to live in that very squat. He talked about what it was like, how they used to repair and hack things, the violence they faced at the hands of police, the state, and drug violence. He talked about the friends he loved and lost, how the buildings had changed over time, and we got to ask him tons of questions about his experience. These types of tours I eventually realized happen a lot in this space, those who used to live at this squat and neighboring squats were still involved in stewarding the experiences and passing on the history to interested parties. Not only was this a hub of archival ephemera and learning history, it was a culturally and physically embedded site for oral history. I thought that was truly special.

Key insights from this trip:
- The idea of an archive being physical is much more than tangible documents, it can also be the place in which it is held. The archival container can be an archival object as well
- Again the idea of living archives requiring messiness, letting this die, and real people stewarding a morphing and changing collection
- The question of "Who is this for! Who decides!" People should have agency over how their history is remembers, getting together and creating collective archives and spaces for such helps with this rather than placing this responsibility in the hands of "professional archivists"
