## my primary research questions
1. In what ways do archival technologies (Flickr, IG, Tumblr, Are.na, YouTube,  custom platforms etc) mediate the relationship between users and their data in ways that alter how they think about the contours and affects of memory, ownership, privacy, and capture.

2. How do current data paradigms disturb and restrict our methods of knowledge-making, kin-making, and place-making?

3. How might archival forms of data fugitivity and disobedience serve as methods of designing otherwise?

## jottings
- you have to be really intimate with the pieces of works, reading everything veyr closely and flip through the pages in order to contribute to the categorizing
- not a process were you can speed through, pickup, and do very easily
- they promoted, esp if its your first time to go slow, be intentional, read through things, and get to know th esetup and environments, the lots, and the documents themselves
- this focus on closeness with the material was really cool!
- There was something said about traditional archiving organizing this more like a tree/hierachy? But instead, they organize things by category. For instance, one category may say Queer, under that it would be like Trans or Lesbian, and it would be in nested categories rather than specific tags for each thing. This way, things can exist in more general buckets if need be and nuances specificity can be added
- They used this software called collective access that they seem to have qualms with but nothing specifcally mentioned
- They're very chill (compared to trad archives) about food and drink being around. It was someones birthday and they had cake and wine and things, people sang.
- It was referred to as a collections party and that framing of it being a party encourages a celebration around the material
- In them talking about digitizing, they discussed how when people originally sort materials, its sorted based on your subjective perspective on what the material is trying to say or what its about. There was a lot of niche categories so the might be something that goes into antifascist but also go into feminist works. Different peoples perspectives could cause them to put things in different places, which obviously can cause some problems when your going back to try to find things. But it also allows to paint a picture of each individual archivist that has helped to steward a space.
- In the process of digitizing, this subjectivity can make it difficult to create a universal standard for labeling and sorting but its still doable and thats somethig they embrace. They said that in their digitizing process, they're not so fixated on the idea of putting things in the "correct" or "accurate" category, they are putting things in the category that it was placed in. It doesn't matter that people may disagree about how something is labeled, all that matters is that the digital labeling connects to the physical so it can be found. The technical is focused on utility rather than precision

## field notes
On Monday November 24th I attended the Collections Working Party at Interference Archive which is a grassroots archive in Park Slope that houses ephemera primarily on social movements. They describe themselves as "an archive from below" leaning on community power and stewardship as core tenents of their operating. Every two weeks or so they host what's referred to as a Collections Working Party which is described as follows on their website:

>Join the collections management working group in doing some work in the collection! We’ll be organizing and filing new donations and cataloging books. No experience necessary – if you’re interested in getting more familiar with the collection, this is a great opportunity. 

When I walked into the space, I was met with someone doing some sorting in the many boxes in the front room. They asked me if I was there for the exhibit or the working party or just to hang and I tentitavley said that I was open to experiencing the space however that day. I went in intenting to just observe the space, maybe take part in the working party but to feel it out. I think with these types of spaces, I feel apprehensive about whether I would have useful insight or ability to contribute to the space. I assume a sort of professionalism around archiving and assume that I dont have the credentials. But the energy in the space was more than welcoming. I suppose that that in it of itself is an assumption that may come from traditional archiving spaces where there is a hierarchy around the archivist as a sociopolitical postion and the subject being archived. Here it felt different.

It was someones birthday when I approached the table, they had cakes and candle and invited me to sit alongside them, all introducing themselves and asking my name. We sang happy birthday and shared food. Even this felt like a different energy around archives that I had never encountered. When we as a class went to see the archives and engage with materials, there was no food or drink allowed around the materials. Things were sealed and there were even items that we weren't allowed to keep. While there were definitley measures to keep the materials safe (like having things wrapped in plastic and keeping the temperature low) there was a more casual attitude towards how we exist around the archives. It was if we were living amongst the documents, creating new memories in their midst. It's a different type of relationship with the documents, not of contempt or carelessness but familiarity and knowing.

After they gave us a little crash course on how to sort through the collections, we were set on our way. I remember around half of the volunteers also being first timers and we all discussed semi nervous and overwhealmed with the amount of materials, building our bravery and understanding only through combing through boxes, reading through the documents closely, and talking through them together. It was a slow, communal, and connective process that build our familiarity and confidence more over time. I loved that while there was infrastructure to help get to know the collections a bit better like keys and diagrams, in order to know where something went, you simply had to read it and use your intuition or discernment. It was a practice in trusting your knowledge and perspective while reaching for others. I remember there was this booklet that I found that I assumed would have gone in the zine area because as a zinester myself, it had a similar visual language and was presumable self-published. From my lived perspective that was my instinct. But since I wasn't sure I asked 2 other volunteers to get their take. After much discussion, flipping through the pages together, we decided to put it into pamphlets. Under pamphlets there were more decisions to make, was this booklet about prison abolition or about food distros. We read through and found that those were the primary themes but to decide where specifically to place the text only came out of repeated discussion, curiosity, questioning, and dialog with one another.

On my way out I connected with some of the other volunteers on Instagram, one of which had recently moved to NYC. They had mentioned how special it felt to be able to get involve in the community on this level, building a connection with people and history through this printed ephemera. I thought that connective dialog was what was the most key about this space and this time sorting. This history that we archive only really means something when we engage closely with the material. We live with it, know it, and grow alongside it.

My primary insights from this journey was:
- Situated and plural dialog around archives supporting the stewardship and sustainability of archives but also community connectedness
- How we label things should live, grow, and morph based on those whom the labels are in service of
- Slowness and intentionality builds intimacy builds confidence and a deeper, more embodied/intuitive knowing
- there is this implicity friction between present day archival technologies and grassroots archives due to 
    - the rigiditiy and stagnation of metadata
    - precision > utility
    - the immateriality of the content
    - technical and time barriers to entry
    - not lending to dialog
- I think fugitive technologies should encourage discomfort, inquiry, and hack our behavior
- We must be forced to build intimacy with our documents and data through repetitive encounters, memorization, retention, and selectivity
