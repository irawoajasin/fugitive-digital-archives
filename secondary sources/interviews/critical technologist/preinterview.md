## What research question(s) are you trying to answer?
For this interview, I set out to answer a question adjacent to the research questions I outlined prior. In my personal readings and exploration, I have been thinking about the relationship between the human desire for connection/intimacy and different models of digital infrastructure that operate on centralized logics and assumptions that work to surveil us. I wanted to use this interview to zoom a bit out of my initial research questions and help me re-clarify specific questions I’d like to move forwards with. That said, the question I was trying to answer with this interview was compared to our typical centralized models, in what ways do community owned or hyperlocal digital infrastructures afford different types of relationships with our everyday technologies as well as with each other? (thinking of how intimacy with our tech and environments might be changed)

## Who are you interviewing? Name, age, background information
For their privacy, the interviewee requested for me to not include any identifying information in this transcript but they are an organizer with NYCMesh, a decentralized and community owned internet project.

## What makes them a good interview subject for this question?
I knew that I wanted to interview people who worked directly with digital privacy and autonomous infrastructures so I could ask them about how these technologies worked, what values they uphold that differ from conventional infrastructures, and for anecdotal stories about how the use of these infrastructures change people's relationships with their tech, their communities, and themselves.

## What is your interview script (at least 8-12 questions)?
Hi [redacted], just want to give some context on this research...

In a surveillance state filled with applications and tools that extract as much data about us as possible, we often find ourselves forced into algorithmic boxes of identity and community all driven by profit. I think about this as us being algorithmically corralled into the most efficient economic actors we can be. However, through talking to various people about the effects of this, I've repeatedly heard about experiences where people feel alienated by their "algorithm" and how they often feel dehumanized and mislabled.

For Queer people especially this concept of being restricted into very legible data points is violence. In this work, I'm pulling a lot from queer theory themes of invisibility, and opacity, not being easily read or understood by moments of data extraction. What I'm curious about exploring is how smaller more hyperlocal ways of looking at data can enforce privacy, autonomy, and most of all true human intimacy! 

With learning about your work with NYC mesh, I felt like it represents and interesting example of technological infrastructures of intimacy, where it requires community participation, ownership, and presence to even operate. It very much feels like a labor of love! With that I feel like you may have a unique perspective that I wanted to interview you about!

Before we begin, can I record a transcript of this session just for my notes for class? No quotes, comments, recordings, or identifying information about you will be used and I'll be deleting the recording after I take notes about my reflections from our conversation and using the transcript for documentation.

### questions
1. What brought you to NYCMesh? What about the project called to you?
2. Can you tell me a little bit about NYCMesh and how it works?
3. What are some ways that a mesh network differs from a more hierarchical or centralized network? Both from the ways that the actual technologies work and the values you feel they uphold differently.
4. What is the value of community owned technologies? Do you have any stories about the power of it in the well-being and connection of a community?
5. From your personal experience, how has working on and using a project like NYC Mesh change the way you relate to technology?
6. What would you say is the value of having private, secure, and encrypted technologies? Do you have any examples?
7. So as mentioned before, a big focus on my project is on legibility, being rendered clear and understandable by the algorithm. Has there been a time in the past, say month, where it felt like your phone, an app, or other piece of technology was trying (maybe failing) to identify who you are?
    - “What were your thoughts in that moment?”
    - “How did that moment make you feel about the technology you were interacting with?”
    - “Did that moment impact your attitude towards the tech?”
    - “Did that moment make you feel different about yourself?”
8. When interacting with these types of technologies, what do you wish they understood about you, if anything? What do you hope it never will know about you?
