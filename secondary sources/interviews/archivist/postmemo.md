## my primary research questions
1. In what ways do archival technologies (Flickr, IG, Tumblr, Are.na, YouTube,  custom platforms etc) mediate the relationship between users and their data in ways that alter how they think about the contours and affects of memory, ownership, privacy, and capture.

2. How do current data paradigms disturb and restrict our methods of knowledge-making, kin-making, and place-making?

3. How might archival forms of data fugitivity and disobedience serve as methods of designing otherwise?

## intentions with this interview
Understand how Black archives and community-stewarded archives differ from traditional archives. Investigating the relationship between Black Radical Tradition and archival methods. Learning more about the specifics of archival methods and what the day to day looks like.

## post interview thoughts
- The beauty in this for me was thinking about knowledge as something that is inherently dialogic and evolving, not static. I think that is often a preconception or misunderstanding of archives that they exist in dusty old collections and remain in the past. At the Black Archives, the place being used as a community space just as much as its used as an archive (as the archivist stated is pretty common within community-run archives), there's a encouragement to regularly engage with the material, understanding your relationality to it.
