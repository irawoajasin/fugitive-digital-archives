## What research question(s) are you trying to answer?
1. In what ways do archival technologies (Flickr, IG, Tumblr, Are.na, YouTube,  custom platforms etc) mediate the relationship between users and their data in ways that alter how they think about the contours and affects of memory, ownership, privacy, and capture.

2. How do current data paradigms disturb and restrict our methods of knowledge-making, kin-making, and place-making?

3. How might archival forms of data fugitivity and disobedience serve as methods of designing otherwise?
